## Introduction

For this project, I set out to create an updated and current portfolio to showcase several of my projects that I am most proud of. I intend to share this portfolio with prospective employers or freelance clients, to both advertise my abilities and to provide a central location for accessing my various social media sites and GitHub repositories.

See below for a screenshot of the deployed project:

## Collaborators

I worked closely with my classmate George Schultz for this project, who provided his own portfolio codebase for me to review and utilize. As a result, there will be a notable similarity between our repositories. This is especially so due to working on a tight time constraint to complete this project, which resulted in less room for me to fully modify the projects layout and content to my own preferences. I plan to continue development on this project and implement more features in the near future.
